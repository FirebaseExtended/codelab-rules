## How to use this repository

This repository is meant to be used with the [Rules
Codelab](https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/firebase-rules#0), which is also dupicated in this [repo](https://github.com/firebase/codelab-rules/blob/main/index.lab.md).

There are two folders in this respository, `initial-state` and
`final-state`. To walk through the codelab, clone down the project,
`git clone github.com/firebase/rules-codelab`, `cd initial-state`,
and then follow along with the [codelab steps](). If you get stuck
or want to see the final rules, check out `final-state`, instead.
