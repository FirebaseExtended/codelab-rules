## How to use this repository

This repository is meant to be used with the [Rules
Codelab](https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/firebase-rules#0), which is also duplicated
in this [repo](https://github.com/firebase/codelab-rules/blob/main/index.lab.md).

There are two folders in this respository, `initial-state` and `final-state`. To walk 
through the codelab, clone down the project, `cd initial-state`, and then follow along
with the [codelab steps](https://github.com/firebase/codelab-rules/blob/main/index.lab.md). 
If you get stuck or want to see the final rules, check out `final-state`, instead.
